                Jonathan Dwight Jones, born July 19, 1987, is an American professional mixed martial artist
                currently signed to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is the current UFC
                Heavyweight Champion. He is a former two-time UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, holding the title
                from March 2011 to April 2015 and from December 2018 to August 2020. Jones also held the interim UFC 
                Light Heavyweight Championship in 2016. As of March 7, 2023, he is #1 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound 
                rankings.<br><br>

                Jones was born on July 19, 1987 in Rochester, New York. His father Arthur is a pastor at Mount 
                Sinai Church of God in Christ in Binghamton, New York. Arthur discouraged Jon's fighting career,
                "I wanted him to preach. I tried to discourage him from being a fighter. I told him you don't want 
                to do that. You can do other things. Be a pastor." Jon's mother, Camille, died in 2017 at the 
                age of 55, after a long battle with diabetes.<br><br>

                Jon was one of four children. His older brother, Arthur, is a former American football defensive 
                lineman who played for the Baltimore Ravens, Indianapolis Colts and Washington Redskins, while his 
                younger brother, Chandler, is an outside linebacker for the Las Vegas Raiders. His older sister, 
                Carmen, died of a brain tumor before her 18th birthday.
